        <p>Tucker Martin</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article-container-body">
        <p>
          He met his father at the same highfalutin restaurant in West Van’s
          British Properties called <i>On the Hill</i> that they’d been going to
          since the divorce. It was a place for high profile businessmen, high
          ranking government workers, and the occasional stuffy celebrity.
          Tucker hated it. They sat at the same table with a stunning view
          overlooking the Burrard Inlet and the ships transporting everything
          imaginable in and out of it; and he watched with a longing to escape,
          as if confined to a prison cell.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Don’t tell me about your work, I’m not interested,” his father
          started. It wasn’t the worst thing he’d opened with before. “I’ve
          asked Sharon to marry me. We’re getting married next spring.” It was
          his fourth.
        </p>
        <p>“You sure you’ll be able to make it that long?”</p>
        <p>
          “Hold your tongue, boy. We were going to this fall, but I caught wind
          of an Indian Band trying to set up a large gaming facility on their
          reserve without the province’s input. Bloody hassle negotiating with
          them,” he growled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tucker had meant for the jab to be about his father’s health; he
          looked red- faced and old, as if he were constantly having minor heart
          attacks by the minute that were making him look more dead than alive.
          He may have had a couple of more heart attacks since the last time
          they saw each other for all Tucker knew. But his father took the
          remark to be about his short attention span with women, and his
          irritability suggested he’d grown sensitive around that topic,
          something Tucker found rather interesting. He looked at his father’s
          heavily made up face, the red beaming through like a ripe piece of
          meat, and felt a mixture of pity and contempt for him. It wasn’t the
          first time he’d felt these emotions, he realized, but it was
          distinctly clear to him that it was obvious this time. His father was
          showing signs of worry, confusion, and shame. Tucker relished it.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, it’s just like you to let work control the rest of your life,”
          he said boldly, though there was noticeable hesitancy in his voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          His father gave a playful scoff, as if he enjoyed his son’s weak and
          simpleminded remark. With heavy condescension in his voice, he said,
          “So sensitive, just like your mum. How is she?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Tucker shrugged his shoulders; it wasn’t that he didn’t care for his
          mother, but that he didn’t care to talk about her with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The waiter brought in the first disgusting display of pretension and
          went off on a two minute rant explaining everything about it, as if
          anyone ever cared or asked for the info. Tucker was in a mood and
          interrupted at every chance to make a point of it.
        </p>
        <p>“Our first course is haricots verts—”</p>
        <p>“Green beans, you mean.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, that’s right…Haricots verts.”</p>
        <p>“Say ‘green beans’.”</p>
        <p>
          “…green beans…with smoked duck breast from Harrington Farm. The duck
          was raised—”
        </p>
        <p>“Continue on, nobody cares where it’s from.”</p>
        <p>The waiter’s face went pale. “Uh, the smoke is a mixture of—”</p>
        <p>
          Tucker stuck his fork into the duck and shoved it into his mouth,
          chomping noisily in front of the waiter. “Continue.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Senator Martin, as if watching a play and thoroughly invested in the
          outcome of the two characters, looked eagerly at them.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Um, the dressing is a vinaigrette of framboise, wildflower honey, and
          sea salt.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Good lord! Raspberry vinegar dressing. Or Raspberry vinaigrette, but
          not both. Wild flower honey? What does wild flower taste like? That’s
          not rhetorical. Tell me.”
        </p>
        <p>“I’m not sure, sir.”</p>
        <p>
          “And sea salt? What’s this here?” he asked, pointing to the table
          salt.
        </p>
        <p>“Table salt, sir.”</p>
        <p>
          “Will it be ok for me to mix the two salts without the chef imploding
          in his large chef’s hat?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, sea salt has more minerals, sir. It’s less refined than table
          salt.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “So the minerals will be adding a certain je ne sais quois to the
          dish? Is that it?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Precisely, sir,” he replied, happily, not catching the sarcasm in
          Tucker’s voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Very well then,” Tucker said, finishing the small amount of food in
          two more large bites and handing him back the plate. “Yes. Delicious.
          Compliments to the chef on his choice of minerals.”
        </p>
        <p>The waiter left, shaking, as if he’d just been mugged, or worse.</p>
        <p>
          A thought went through Senator Martin’s brain and was reflected in his
          small, narrow brown eyes. He narrowed them further, if that was at all
          possible, and formulated his thoughts into words. His son turned his
          gaze away deliberately, and just by this Senator Martin knew he’d
          already figured out what was on his mind. “Hm, perhaps he’s smarter
          than I thought,” Senator Martin mused to himself. He let him stew in
          limbo for another minute before opening his large mouth and exposing
          his whitened smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’ve a grand idea,” he said, looking out at the inlet as his son did.
          “I’d like to put you on retainer, with the province, and put you in
          charge of handling this sensitive and important case. You’ll liaise
          directly with the Indian Band and report to…” he paused to think for a
          moment. He didn’t want to have his son reporting to him, that was too
          dynastic, and in all likelihood would simply be a nuisance. At last he
          shrugged his shoulders. “Oh, anyone will do. I’ll send you the
          information.”
        </p>
        <p>“I don’t want to,” Tucker said, sullenly.</p>
        <p>
          “Nonsense. This will be beneficial to your career,” he began to
          proselytize, but something was different in his son’s tone and posture
          than before. He seemed more steadfast, more stubborn. The Senator
          wondered about the difference in his son and whether it was real or
          just imagined. Would his same tactics work on him? Could he, for
          example, threaten to cut him off as he usually did? Could he guilt him
          into it? These options felt inadequate this time around. So Senator
          Martin, utilizing one of his many skills, sought agreement through
          different means. “I know you feel I’m harsh with you…and that I’m not
          proud of you. But it’s because I’m proud of you that I push you.
          Perhaps I push too much so that you won’t come back. But really, I’m
          just not as good as I ought to be. To be honest, I need help. I need
          someone capable. And I trust you, because you’re brilliant,
          resourceful, and shrewd, like your old man. You may feel you need to
          prove yourself to me, but you never needed to. I’ve been proud of you
          and convinced of your greatness since the day you were born. So what
          do you say? Take on this job for your old man, and whatever you want
          after, I’ll make a call, or not if that’s what you want or just stay
          out of your way. Up to you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The table next to them found it to be a thoroughly moving speech. They
          waited with baited breath for the reconciliation of father and son to
          take place, for the son to leap up over the table and hug his dear old
          dad, for his dad to break that time-old hardness and shed a tear for
          his devoted son. Should they applaud? Should they congratulate them?
          Should they toast them? The table next to them were practically in
          tears as they thought of their own parents and their own children and
          their duties to each. Was there a newspaper editor somewhere in the
          restaurant that could get a photo and write a short but heartwarming
          blurb about the magical moment on the mountain between a father and
          his son? It would be an inspiration to everyone. Stop your bellyaching
          and call your father and say sorry! call your brother and make amends!
          call your mother before you regret it for the rest of your life!
        </p>
        <p>
          But Tucker’s face had turned a fabulously scornful shade of red and
          before he uttered his next words, his father knew he’d slipped up.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You said that last year,” he said, grinding each word out between his
          teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Damn it,” Senator Martin said to himself. “I’m getting old.” Then
          with a careless wave of his hand as if he possessed magical abilities,
          as was something he’d done many times over and over and something he
          would continue to do until his death, said to his son, “Well, you’ll
          do it anyway or I’ll cut you off and out of the will. I’d invite you
          to my wedding but it’s a two hundred dollar ticket. Probably a bit
          much for you on your assistant’s salary. See you in six months.” And
          with that, Senator Martin left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tucker Martin, after a moment’s reflection, scoffed, took a sip of
          water, and left the stuffy restaurant. He didn’t even bother to glance
          around at the nearby tables to witness the look of shock,
          embarrassment, and sympathy pouring out of their faces at what had
          transpired. He didn’t care. He’d seen the looks a thousand times
          before.
